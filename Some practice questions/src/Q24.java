//    Collections Classes:
//
//    What is it?
//    In Java, the Collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provide essential data structures like lists, sets, and maps for storing and manipulating collections of objects.
//    Why do we need it?
//    Collections classes help manage and manipulate data efficiently, providing methods for common operations like adding, removing, and iterating over elements.
//   Example: Using an ArrayList to store and manipulate a collection of integers.
//
//
//    List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
//numbers.add(1);
//numbers.add(2);
//numbers.remove(0);
//    Static:
//
//    What is it?
//    The static keyword in Java is used to declare class-level members (variables and methods) that belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class.
//    Why do we need it?
//    Static members are shared among all instances of a class and can be accessed without creating an object. They are often used for utility methods or constants.
//    Example: A static method that calculates the square of a number.
//
//    public class MathUtils {
//        public static int square(int num) {
//            return num * num;
//        }
//    }
//    int result = MathUtils.square(5);
//    Volatile:
//
//    What is it?
//    The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads. It ensures that all reads and writes to the variable are visible to other threads.
//    Why do we need it?
//    Volatile variables are used in multithreading to prevent thread interference and ensure consistent visibility of shared data.
//            Example: Declaring a volatile variable in a multi-threaded scenario.
//
//    public volatile int sharedVariable;
//    Synchronize:
//
//    What is it?
//    Synchronization in Java is a technique to control access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. It's implemented using the synchronized keyword.
//    Why do we need it?
//    Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a synchronized block or method at a time, preventing data corruption in concurrent scenarios.
//            Example: Synchronizing a method to protect a critical section.
//
//    public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
//        // Critical section code
//    }
//    Serialize:
//
//    What is it?
//    Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be saved to a file or sent over the network. It's used for object persistence.
//    Why do we need it?
//    Serialization is essential for saving and restoring object states and for communication in distributed systems.
//    Example: Serializing and deserializing an object.
//
//    // Serialization
//    ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("object.ser"));
//outputStream.writeObject(myObject);
//
//    // Deserialization
//    ObjectInputStream inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("object.ser"));
//    MyObject deserializedObject = (MyObject) inputStream.readObject();
//    Inner Classes:
//
//    What is it?
//    Inner classes (or nested classes) in Java are classes defined within another class. They can be static or non-static (inner classes).
//    Why do we need it?
//    Inner classes are used to logically group classes, improve encapsulation, and access the members of the outer class.
//    Example: Defining an inner class within an outer class.
//
//    public class Outer {
//        private int outerVar;
//
//        public class Inner {
//            public void display() {
//                System.out.println("Inner class variable: " + outerVar);
//            }
//        }
//    }
  }
